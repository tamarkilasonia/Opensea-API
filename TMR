Batch 8 Data Engineering Intern Project Assignment

Develop ETL pipeline with OpenSea API

Using the ORM that you have developed in Stage 1, write an ETL pipeline to extract data from
the OpenSea Collections API which is an up to date historical collection. Focus on the ethereum
chain, extract collections only about ethereum, transform it as required, and load it into a table
of your choice.

mapping, data aggregation).
Data Loading
● Load the transformed data into a table using the custom ORM.
● In addition to loading data into the database, save raw data in data lake (CSV or JSON
format. Destination of the raw data and the way you save it is up to you
Table Design:
● You should design a table to store the extracted OpenSea Collections data. The
